# NewAge
NewAge is primarily a new Text adventure game engine that will eventually incorporate minor Point and Click/Dialog Adventure Game features that will partly mimic a Point and Click Adventure Game, 1st person adventure and a Text Adventure Game/Visual Novel while utilizing Dialogs. It will feature a fully cross platform editor and a fully cross platform game engine and its own scripting language to make creating games easier. This will not feature a pathfinding engine.
